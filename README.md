# DSA Coding Patterns

A comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implementations and coding patterns for technical interview preparation and competitive programming.

## 📚 About

This repository contains well-documented implementations of common data structures, algorithms, and coding patterns frequently encountered in technical interviews and competitive programming. Each implementation includes:

- Clear, readable code with comments
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Test cases and examples
- Step-by-step explanations where applicable

## 📊 Problems Quick Reference

| Problem Name | Pattern | Difficulty | Quick Interview Tip |
|-------------|---------|------------|---------------------|
| [Pair Sum in Sorted Array](1.Two-Pointers/1.1.Inward-Traversal/pair-sum-sorted.py) | Two Pointers (Inward) | Easy | **Sorted array + target sum** → Use two pointers from both ends, move based on sum comparison |

> **Note**: This table will be updated as more problems are added to the repository.

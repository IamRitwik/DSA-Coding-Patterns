# DSA Coding Patterns

A comprehensive collection of Data Structures and Algorithms implementations and coding patterns for technical interview preparation and competitive programming.

## 📚 About

This repository contains well-documented implementations of common data structures, algorithms, and coding patterns frequently encountered in technical interviews and competitive programming. Each implementation includes:

- Clear, readable code with comments
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Test cases and examples
- Step-by-step explanations where applicable

## 🗂️ Repository Structure

The repository is organized by topics and patterns:

- **Data Structures**: Arrays, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, Heaps, Hash Tables, etc.
- **Algorithms**: Sorting, Searching, Graph Algorithms (DFS, BFS, Dijkstra, etc.)
- **Patterns**: Two Pointers, Sliding Window, Recursion, Dynamic Programming, etc.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/IamRitwik/DSA-Coding-Patterns.git
cd DSA-Coding-Patterns
```

2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

### Running the Code

Each file can be run independently:

```bash
python3 path/to/file.py
```

## 📖 Usage

Browse through the repository to find implementations of specific data structures or algorithms. Each file typically contains:

- Implementation of the data structure/algorithm
- Helper methods and utilities
- Test cases in the `main()` function
- Complexity analysis in comments

## 🤝 Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add new implementations or improve existing ones:

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b feature/new-pattern`)
3. Make your changes
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add new pattern'`)
5. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/new-pattern`)
6. Open a Pull Request
